## Controls and mechanics üïπÔ∏è
### Moving üõß
Space-road consists of 5 lanes that you can easily move between. Your spaceship can only move 1 lane to the left or to the right. Also, spaceship has slight acceleration, so the further you go, the harder it gets!
* Press **A** key to move left
* Press **D** key to move right

### Energy ‚ö°
Energy is a very useful resource that can help you in critical situations. Energy is a resource that is automatically replenished, but needs time to start recharging. Energy has 2 uses:

1. **Laser** - powerful weapon that can destroy incoming asteroids. Beware: bigger asteroids have more health and take more time to destroy.

2. **Slow-down** - halves your spaceship's velocity as long as this ability is being used.

* Hold **Space** key to shoot laser
* Hold **S** key to slow-down

### Health ‚ù§Ô∏è
Your spaceship has fixed amount of health that cannot be replenished. Health is lost on every collision with an asteroid and amount of damage dealt is proportional to the size of the asteroid (tip: crash into smaller asteroids if collision is inevitable).
Once your health reaches zero, your spaceship is destroyed - game over.
